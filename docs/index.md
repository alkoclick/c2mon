# C2MON

## What is C2MON?

The CERN Control and Monitoring Platform (C2MON) is essentially a heterogeneous data acquisition framework with configuration, persistence, historical browsing, control and alarm functionalities. It has been developed for CERNâ€™s demanding infrastructure monitoring needs and is based on more than 10 years of experience with the Technical Infrastructure Monitoring (TIM) systems at CERN.

It comes with a simple and intuitive data subscription API with integrated history browsing capabilities that can be used to form the basis for industrial dashboards and other graphical monitoring applications. Powerful data filtering and configuration mechanisms help fine tune data flow and prevent data burst situations.
